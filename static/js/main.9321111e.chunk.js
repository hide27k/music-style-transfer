Such automated music generation study involves multiple complications such as learning the style, generating the music, alternating amplitudes to comply with the targeted style while preserving the melody/lyrics of the original input, etc. Not only is this study combining polyphonic songs unprecedented, but also such an operation that writes a song into a different genre is even hard for humans to imagine and might require skilled musicians to perform some fine tuning. Therefore, taking two inputs and performing a style transfer on the go turns out to be more complex than expected. Due to limited time, we decided to train the model with the style of a certain song ahead of time and only take one input song to be transferred.

In order to train the network to learn a style/genre, we also used an additional dataset consisting of 10 genres with 100 songs of each genre. All the songs are cropped to 30 seconds.

This model takes 40 features of an audio file and outputs the predicted classification. In order to use this model, we need to supply it with 40 features whereas our main model outputs 50 raw values of amplitudes. Hence, we introduce a third model that takes 50 values and extracts 40 features that are associated with these values, which could then be fed into the classifier.

So, before feeding the audio file into the network, the values are all normalized to be within [-1, 1]. Then, we denormalize the output by adding a fully connected layer after LSTM to restore to the common range of  amplitudes.

While the final output does not have a clear Holiday vibe added to it, we think this is an acceptable outcome as the melody, vocals, and major background music is preserved.
